# google-results-page
Deconstructing and rebuilding the Google results page. 
This is the optional, but more difficult CSS/HTML assignment from The Odin Project - (www.theodinproject.com)

Google's current results page is a bit different today than when the project was assigned (based on other's completed projects). I think I'll attempt the older design.
I hope to utilize Classes and IDs well enough that my CSS isn't a mess. 
I expect to struggle with inserting icons and alignment - though I think I know what to do.
