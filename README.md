# google-results-page
Deconstructing and rebuilding the Google results page. 
This is the optional, but more difficult, CSS/HTML assignment from The Odin Project - (www.theodinproject.com)


1.
I hope to utilize Classes and IDs well enough that my CSS isn't a mess. 
I expect to struggle with inserting icons and alignment - though I think I know what to do. 

2.
Worked on wireframing and breaking forming the classes and IDs.
Started building the navigation section. 

3.
The bulk of the results page is completed. Utilized variables for the first time and it's already saved me a bit of time (thanks, variables!)
I learned about reseting the <code>ul</code> to remove indents. 

4. 
Built the Video results section and the bulk of the Image Results section. Learned a little bit about framing the <code>img</code> tag. 

5. 
Welp, its a been a while. I've spent this span of time attending a local Bootstrap course and adjusting to a new job. Now that I'm feeling settled, lets get back into it! Completed the Next Page / Page List section. I was imtimidated to attempt this, but it wasn't bad. 

6. 
Built the search bar, apps icon, and sign in button. This feels like the most difficult part so far. 

7.
My laptop screen died before I pushed my last two sessions of work onto Github. Lesson learned!
