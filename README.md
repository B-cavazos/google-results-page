Started building the navigation section.

The bulk of the results page is completed. Utilized variables for the first time and it's already saved me a bit of time (thanks, variables!)
I learned about reseting the <code>ul</code> to remove indents.

Built the Video results section and the bulk of the Image Results section. Learned a little bit about framing the <code>img</code> tag.
